Abstract: The X chromosome is one of two sex chromosomes. Humans and most mammals have two sex chromosomes, the X and Y. Some individuals have two X chromosomes in their cells, while others have X and Y chromosomes in their cells. Egg cells all contain an X chromosome, while sperm cells contain an X or a Y chromosome. This arrangement means that during fertilization, it is the XY parent that determines the whether the offspring will be XY or XX.

Transcript
"So this, because I'm a female, is truly one of my favorite chromosomes. As you know, females have two X chromosomes. They're quite large in comparison to the male chromosomes. They are carried by the egg, and so consequently you pass on--if you have an egg--you can only pass on an X chromosome to your offspring. What's also quite interesting is the number of genes that are found on the X chromosome. It is predicted that there are approximately 155 million base pairs, which translates to about 900 to 1,400 genes on the X chromosome. Meaning that it carries about five percent of the total DNA in the entire cell. Which is quite in contrast to the Y chromosome, which is considerably smaller. Again, if you look at the X chromosomes in the genes that it carries, often times you'll see that sex-linked disorders are carried on the X chromosome. Which is why, as I stated before, they're more predominant in male, because there's not a protective mechanism against having a mutation on one of those genes because we don't have the normal copy of that gene on the X chromosome."

Biography

Carla Easter, Ph.D., is chief of the Education and Community Involvement Branch at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). She played a major role in the development of the NHGRI/Smithsonian exhibition Genome: Unlocking Life's Code, and its accompanying website, and serves as a liaison to the K-12 and university community as a speaker on genomic science and career preparation and pathways. Dr. Easter also serves as an adjunct faculty member at the University of the District of Columbia Department of Biology, Chemistry and Physics.

From 2003-2006, Dr. Easter was director of outreach for Washington University School of Medicine's Genome Sequencing Center. Before assuming her role as outreach director, Dr. Easter was a research associate in the Department of Education at Washington University (2001-2003) where she explored the notions of science among secondary students. She served as pre-college coordinator for the NASA Summer High School Apprenticeship Research Plus Program and project associate for the Quality Education for Minorities Network. From 1997-2000, Dr. Easter conducted post-doctoral research at Washington University School of Medicine on the virulence factors associated with Streptococcus pyogenes.

Dr. Easter earned her bachelor's degree in microbiology from the University of California, Los Angeles and her doctoral in biology with an emphasis on molecular genetics from the University of California, San Diego.
