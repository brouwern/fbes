# Introduction

This website is a compilation of materials open-access and/or free materials on biology, bioinformatics, and environmental science.  Most of the pages are entries pages from Wikipedia or entries from the NHGRI's [Talking Glossary](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary) (https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary).  Some entries are from other sources, and I've contributed a things I've written myself.
