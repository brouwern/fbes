<h1><span class="header-section-number"> 3</span> When things are homolgous AND analogous!</h1>
<p>By: Dr. Brouwer</p>
<p>The topics of homologous and analogous structures are often discussed in relation to convergent evolution and homoplasy. It can be difficult to keep track of the exact definitions and when each term applies; in this short reading, I’ll reiterate the difference between homologous and analogous features and discuss an important facet that is often not brought up when these things are discussed.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQmb6B8c_TI">Mometrix video</a> – like many videos on the topic – they discuss homologous structures by comparing the arm of a human, the wing of a bat, the flipper of a whale, and the front leg of a cat (1:31). All of these anatomical structures contain the exact same bones, though they are used for different forms of movement.</p>

<p>To be more precise and clearer, instead of calling these arms, fins etc, they should call them forelimbs. At the level of bone structure, these forelimbs are homologous. Their homology is defined based on similar development and morphology and has nothing to do with function. To me, to refer to these different organisms’ forelimbs as arms, flippers etc. brings in aspects of function which aren’t relevant to consideration of homology and can cause confusion when you start thinking about analogous structures and convergent evolution.</p>
<!-- Image mometrix 2 -->
<p>When they discuss analogous structures, they show the wings of bats, birds, and butterflies. Bat wings and bird wings are analogous structures. (Comparing vertebrate and insect wings is a trivial example but a useful starting point). Vetebrate wings have the same function - flight - but have key differences. For example, bats create the wing using membranes derived from skin tissue (epidermis), while birds use feathers (which are derived from scales). Moreover, bats spread out the membranes of their wings with their fingers, while birds spread out their feathers by making the feathers themselves stiff. These structures are therefore analogous when we consider them from the perspective of anatomical function. Therefore, while discussion of homology doesn’t require considering function, discussion of analogy does. In contrast, the flippers of whales and dolphins are not analogous because they share a common ancestor with flippers, and they function the same.</p>
<p>From the perspective of natural selection, bat wings and bird wings are also an example of convergent evolution. Starting from different initial types of organisms - terrestrial rodents and terrestrial dinosaurs, respectively - both bats and birds converged on the ecological strategy of flight. That is, they converged on the strategy of using their forelimbs as wings. (You could say birds and butterflies converged on the strategy of flight but this is trivial since they do very different things while flying; bats and birds, however, often compete for the same resources, are eaten by similar predators, etc).</p>
<p>But wait - in our above example of forelimbs we had humans, whales, cats and birds, and we said these were homologous. These are all tetrapods, and bats are tetrapods too, so shouldn’t bat forelimbs also be homologous to these others? Yes, bat forelimbs are homologous to all these others. But we just said that bat wings and bird wings are analogous! Yes, that’s true too. At the level of the forelimb bone structure, bird and bat forelimbs are homologous. But at the level of the functional wings, they are analogous because they achieve their function - key to consideration of analogy and convergent evolution - very differently.</p>
<p>Sadava et al (11th edition) puts it this way</p>
<p>“Any features shared by two or more species that have been inherited from a common ancestor are said to be homologous. Homologous features may be any heritable trait, including DNA sequences, protein structures, anatomical structures, and even some behavior patterns. For example, all living vertebrates have a vertebral column, as did the ancestral vertebrate. Therefore the vertebral column is judged to be homologous in all vertebrates.</p>
<p>“…similar traits may evolve independently in different lineages, a phenomenon called convergent evolution. For example, although the wing bones [I say forelimbs] of bats and birds are homologous, having been inherited from a common tetrapod ancestor, the wings of bats and birds are not homologous because they evolved independently from forelimbs of different nonflying ancestors. Functionally similar structures that have independent evolutionary origins are called analogous characters.” Sadava et al (11th edition, pg 451).</p>

<p><strong>Transcript</strong>: “Homozygous describes the genetic condition or the genetic state where an individual has inherited the same DNA sequence for a particular gene from both their biological mother and their biological father. It’s often used in the context of disease. We talk about a situation where an individual has inherited a mutant allele or an error in DNA sequence from their mother and they have inherited the identical mutant allele from their father. We would then say that individual is homozygous for that mutation. They have two identical copies of the deleterious version of that gene and, as a result, they are then going to be predisposed to the genetic condition the gene codes for.”</p>

<p>genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Insertion</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: “Insertion is a type of mutation involving the addition of genetic material. An insertion mutation can be small, involving a single extra DNA base pair, or large, involving a piece of a chromosome.”</p>
<p>Image: <a href="https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/tg/en/illustration/insertion.jpg" class="uri">https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/tg/en/illustration/insertion.jpg</a></p>

<p><strong>Transcript</strong> “Insertion really means that something has been stuck in there. And again, as a geneticist, when we think of an insertion, we think of a piece of DNA, and that can be small or large, being stuck in at a place where it really doesn’t belong. So an insertion of just one base pair could lead to something that we call a frameshift. It shifts the reading of the three-base pair code and by that can throw off the entire protein, and by that can lead, for example, to a birth defect. Insertion can be larger, that, for example, there is an insertion of three base pairs, and then it will not throw off the frame, or it will not lead to a frameshift, and potentially is less harmful than having the insertion of just one base pair. And of course you can have an insertion of huge pieces of DNA. They can be so large that you could actually see it on the chromosome analysis, where all of the smaller insertions you would see only by sequencing the stretch of DNA.”</p>

<p><strong>Transcript</strong>: “Locus” is a term that we use to tell us where on a chromosome a specific gene is. So it’s really the physical location of a gene or of a DNA polymorphism on a chromosome. And it’s sort of like a street address for people. And one of the things that we think about when we’re thinking about genes and chromosomes is we may think of the chromosome as a country, and then a region of a chromosome would maybe be the city, and then we’ll get down to a very specific area, which is the locus, and that would be equivalent to, say, a person’s street address. And that’s the street address of that gene. An important thing to remember is that the plural of “locus” is “loci”, not “locuses”.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: “A missense mutation is when the change of a single base pair causes the substitution of a different amino acid in the resulting protein. This amino acid substitution may have no effect, or it may render the protein nonfunctional.”</p>

<p><strong>Transcript</strong>: “A missense mutation is a mistake in the DNA which results in the wrong amino acid being incorporated into a protein because of change, that single DNA sequence change, results in a different amino acid codon which the ribosome recognizes. Changes in amino acid can be very important in the function of a protein. But sometimes they make no difference at all, or very little difference. Sometimes missense mutations cause amino acids to be incorporated, which make the protein more effective in doing its job. More frequently, it causes the protein to be less effective in doing its job. But this is really the grist of evolution, when missense mutations happen, and therefore small changes, frequently small changes in proteins, happen, and it happens to be that it improves the function of a protein. That will sometimes give the organism that has it a competitive advantage over its colleagues and be maintained in the population.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Mitochondrial-DNA" class="uri">https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Mitochondrial-DNA</a></p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: “Mitochondrial DNA is the small circular chromosome found inside mitochondria. The mitochondria are organelles found in cells that are the sites of energy production. The mitochondria, and thus mitochondrial DNA, are passed [almost always - but there are exceptions!] from mother to offspring.”</p>
<p>Note: Mitochondrial DNA is frequently used in population genetics and phylogenetics. Its almost always (like 99.999999% of the time) inherited maternally which has useful properties when constructing phylogenies and tracing the history of populations.</p>

<p>Animation: <a href="https://youtu.be/TiqTAfHhOCo" class="uri">https://youtu.be/TiqTAfHhOCo</a></p>
<p><strong>Transcript</strong>: “Inside the mitochondrion is a certain type of DNA. That’s different in a way from the DNA that’s in the nucleus. This DNA is small and circular. It has only 16,500 or so base pairs in it. And it encodes different proteins that are specific for the mitochondrial. Now, remember those pathways that are within the mitochondrion for producing energy. Some of the enzymes in those pathways, and some of the proteins that are needed to function in those pathways, are produced by the mitochondrial DNA. The mitochondrial DNA is critically important for many of the pathways that produce energy within the mitochondria. And if there’s a defect in some of those mitochondrial DNA bases, that is to say a mutation, you will have a mitochondrial disease, which will involve the inability to produce sufficient energy in things like the muscle and the brain, and the kidney. Mitochondrial DNA, unlike nuclear DNA, is inherited from the mother [almost always - but there are exceptions!], while nuclear DNA is inherited from both parents. So this is very helpful sometimes in determining how a person has a certain disorder in the family. Sometimes a disease will be inherited through the mother’s line, as opposed to both parents. You can tell from a pedigree or a group of family history whether or not this is a mitochondrial disease because of that.”</p>

The change in the genetic code is called a mutation, and throughout our lifetime we actually accumulate many mutations within our cells. And our body has the ability to recognize and repair these mutations. However, if some of these mutations escape repair, they can cause a normal cell to be transformed to become a tumor cell. Therefore, mutations are actually associated with the development of cancer.”</p>

<p><strong>Transcript</strong>: “Mutation has been the source of many Hollywood movies, but it’s really a simple process of a mistake made in a DNA sequence as it’s being copied. Some of that’s just the background noise that DNA copying is not perfect, and we should be glad of that or evolution couldn’t operate. But mutation can also be induced by things like radiation or carcinogens in a way that can increase the risk of cancers or birth defects. But it’s pretty simple; it’s basically an induced misspelling of the DNA sequence. That’s a mutation”</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> Talking Glossary: Non-coding DNA (1 min)</h2>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: “Non-coding DNA sequences do not code for amino acids. Most non-coding DNA lies between genes on the chromosome and has no known function. Other non-coding DNA, called introns, is found within genes. Some non-coding DNA plays a role in the regulation of gene expression.”</p>
<p>Note: Non-coding DNA (previously called junk DNA) makes up 98% of the genome. It is very useful for evolutionary and phylogenetic studies because it is not directly impacted by natural selection.</p>
<p><strong>Transcript</strong>: “Non-coding DNA is just what it says; it’s non-coding DNA. You can think of the genome as being split up into two parts. There’s the stuff that codes for proteins. We call it coding DNA, and for a lack of a better term, the rest of genome is referred to as non-coding DNA. Some people will like to try and refer to this as junk DNA. But I would suggest otherwise, because this represents 98 percent of our genome sequence and it does all sorts of things, like regulate those genes to figure out where they should turn on, where they should turn off, how much we should turn on certain genes, how are we going to pack up the DNA into chromosomes, and so forth. And there are probably a whole host of functions that non-coding DNA does that we still don’t know what it does yet.”</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.11</span> Talking Glossary : Open reading frame definition (3 min)</h2>
<p>National Human Genome Research Institute
<a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Open-Reading-Frame" class="uri">https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Open-Reading-Frame</a> (Links to an external site.)</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: “An open reading frame is a portion of a DNA molecule that, when translated into amino acids, contains no stop codons. The genetic code reads DNA sequences in groups of three base pairs, which means that a double-stranded DNA molecule can read in any of six possible reading frames–three in the forward direction and three in the reverse. A long open reading frame is likely part of a gene.”</p>
<p>Audio: <a href="https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/tg/en/narration/open_reading_frame.mp3" class="uri">https://www.genome.gov/sites/default/files/tg/en/narration/open_reading_frame.mp3</a></p>

Note: This is a good figure, but doesn’t contain all the details discussed in the glossary entry.</p>
<p><strong>Transcript</strong>: “Open reading frame” is a terrible term that we’re stuck with. What it refers to is a frame of reference, and what is being read, “reading”, is the RNA code, and it is being read by the ribosomes in order to make a protein. And “open” means that the road is open to keep reading, and the ribosome will be able to keep reading the RNA code and add another amino acid one after another. Now, DNA, though it is a monotonous repetition of As, Cs, Ts, and Gs, has a language, which is transcribed, of course, into RNA and then translated into a protein. And when it’s translated into a protein, the mRNA is not read one letter at a time, but it’s read three letters at a time. And those three letters are called a codon, and each of those codons, whether it’s an AAA or UUU or an AUG, each of those codons is interpreted by the ribosome, the molecular machine, that’s going to make the protein as a certain amino acid. So AUG codes for one amino acid, and UUU codes for another, and etc. So an open reading frame is the length of DNA, or RNA, which is transcribed into RNA, through which the ribosome can travel, adding one amino acid after another before it runs into a codon that doesn’t code for any amino acid. And when that happens, it confuses the ribosome, and the ribosome stops. So you’ll be pleased to hear that codons, which make that happen are called stop codons, and a stop codon ends an open reading frame. So an open reading frame is sometimes 300 amino acids long, and sometimes maybe it’s 600, and sometimes it’s longer. The longer an open reading frame is, the longer you get before you get to a stop codon, the more likely it is to be part of a gene which is coding for a protein. Now the finally confusing thing about an open reading frame is that because the codons are three nucleic acids long and DNA has two strands, the ribosome can read an RNA derived from one strand or another, and it can read it in 1-2-3s that are separated one from another so you can actually get three reading frames reading in one direction, three reading frames going in the other direction. So it’s actually six different reading frames for every piece of DNA, which might give you an open reading frame.”</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a laboratory technique used to amplify DNA sequences. The method involves using short DNA sequences called primers to select the portion of the genome to be amplified. The temperature of the sample is repeatedly raised and lowered to help a DNA replication enzyme copy the target DNA sequence. The technique can produce a billion copies of the target sequence in just a few hours.</p>

<p><strong>Transcript</strong>: “PCR, or the polymerase chain reaction, is a chemical reaction that molecular biologists use to amplify pieces of DNA. This reaction allows a single or a few copies of DNA to be replicated into millions or billions of copies. And by amplifying that DNA, it allows us to study that DNA molecule in detail in the laboratory.”</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: “A phenotype is an individual’s observable traits, such as height, eye color, and blood type. The genetic contribution to the phenotype is called the genotype. Some traits are largely determined by the genotype, while other traits are largely determined by environmental factors.”</p>

<p><strong>Transcript:</strong> ““Phenotype” simply refers to an observable trait. “Pheno” simply means “observe” and comes from the same root as the word “phenomenon”. And so it’s an observable type of an organism, and it can refer to anything from a common trait, such as height or hair color, to presence or absence of a disease. Frequently, phenotypes are related and used–the term is used–to relate a difference in DNA sequence among individuals with a difference in trait, be it height or hair color, or disease, or what have you. But it’s important to remember that phenotypes are equally, or even sometimes more greatly influenced by environmental effects than genetic effects. So a phenotype can be directly related to a genotype, but not necessarily. There’s usually not a one-to-one correlation between a genotype and a phenotype. There are almost always environmental influences, such as what one eats, how much one exercises, how much one smokes, etc. All of those are environmental influences which will affect the phenotype as well.”</p>
