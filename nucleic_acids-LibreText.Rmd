### DNA and RNA

Nucleic acids are the most important molecules for the continuity of
life. They carry the blueprint of a cell and carry instructions for the
functioning of cell and organisms. There are two main types of nucleic
acids: **deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)** and **ribonucleic acid (RNA)**.
DNA is the **genetic material** found in all living organisms, ranging
from single-celled bacteria to **multicellular** mammals.

The entire genetic content of a cell is known as its **genome**, and the
study of genomes is **genomics**. Many -- but not all -- genes contain
the information to make proteins.

Proteins are one of the most abundant biological molecules in living
systems and have a diverse range of functions. Each cell in a living
system may contain thousands of proteins, each with a unique function.
Their structures, like their functions, vary greatly. They are all,
however, **polymers** of **amino acids**, arranged in a linear sequence.
This sequence is determined by DNA.

DNA molecules don't directly code for proteins, but rather use an
intermediary to communicate with the rest of the cell. This intermediary
is **messenger RNA (mRNA)**.

DNA and RNA are made up of single subunits known as **nucleotides**. The
nucleotides combine with each other to form a long chain of either DNA
or RNA. The sequences of the nucleotides contains the information to
make proteins. In DNA there are four nucleotides: adenine (A), guanine
(G) cytosine (C), and thymine (T).

### DNA Double-Helix Structure

DNA has a double-helix structure made up of two separate strands of
nucleotides. The two strands of the helix run in opposite directions.

Each base from one strand interacts via hydrogen bonding with a base from the opposing strand. (credit: Jerome Walker/Dennis Myts)"} -->

<!-- knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./images/image6.jpeg")) -->

<!-- ``` -->

Only certain types of base pairing are allowed: A can pair with T, and G
can pair with C. This is known as the **base complementary rule**. In
other words, the DNA strands are complementary to each other. If the
sequence of one strand is AATTGGCC, the complementary strand would have
the sequence TTAACCGG. During DNA replication, each strand is copied,
resulting in a new DNA double helix.

<!-- antiparallel to one another so that one strand runs 5′ to 3′ and the -->

<!-- other 3′ to 5′. The phosphate backbone is located on the outside, and -->

<!-- the bases are in the middle. Adenine forms hydrogen bonds (or base -->

<!-- pairs) with thymine, and guanine base pairs with cytosine. -->

<!-- A mutation occurs, and cytosine is replaced with adenine. What impact -->

<!-- do you think this will have on the DNA structure? -->

### RNA

Ribonucleic acid, or RNA, is mainly involved in the process of **protein
synthesis** . RNA is usually **single-stranded** and is made of
ribonucleotides, which are slightly different than nucleotides. RNA can
contain adenine, guanine, cytosine, or uracil ribonucleotides.
Importantly there is no thymine ribonucleotide - uracil takes its place.

<!-- There are four major types of RNA: messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA -->

<!-- (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and microRNA (miRNA). The first, mRNA, -->

RMA molecules called **messenger RNA** (mRNA) carry the message from
DNA. If a cell requires a certain protein to be synthesized, the gene
for this product is turned "on" and the messenger RNA is made using the
appropriate DNA as a template. The RNA base sequence is complementary to
the coding sequence of the DNA from which it has been copied. However,
as just noted, in RNA, the base T is absent and U is present instead. If
the DNA strand has a sequence AATTGCGC, the sequence of the
complementary RNA is UUAACGCG.

Once mRNA is made is can serve as a template for the synthesis of
**proteins**. Proteins or the primary building blocks of cells and
thereby tissues, organs and organisms. For example, muscles are made up
of long filaments of large cells containing bundles of proteins.

<!-- ```{r, echo = F} -->

<!-- knitr::include_graphics(here::here("./images/image8.jpeg")) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Figure 3.5.4 : A ribosome has two parts: a large subunit and a small -->

<!-- subunit. The mRNA sits in between the two subunits. A tRNA molecule -->

<!-- recognizes a codon on the mRNA, binds to it by complementary base -->

<!-- pairing, and adds the correct amino acid to the growing peptide chain. -->

mRNA is read in sets of three bases known as **codons**. Each codon
codes for a single amino acid. Amino acids are the **monomers**
(subunits) that make up proteins. In this way, the mRNA is read and the
protein product is made.

Nucleotides and ribonucleotides are represented by a single letter: A,
T, C, G and U. Similarly, amino acids are represented by a single upper
case letter or a three-letter abbreviation. For example, valine is known
by the letter V or the three-letter code val. The sequence and the
number of amino acids ultimately determine a protein's shape, size, and
function.

<!-- Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a major constituent of ribosomes on which the mRNA binds. The rRNA ensures the properalignment of the mRNA and the ribosomes; the rRNA of the ribosome also -->

<!-- has an enzymatic activity (peptidyl transferase) and catalyzes the -->

<!-- formation of the peptide bonds between two aligned amino acids. -->

<!-- Transfer RNA (tRNA) is one of the smallest of the four types of RNA, -->

<!-- usually 70--90 nucleotides long. It carries the correct amino acid to -->

<!-- the site of protein synthesis. It is the base pairing between the tRNA -->

<!-- and mRNA that allows for the correct amino acid to be inserted in the -->

<!-- polypeptide chain. microRNAs are the smallest RNA molecules and their -->

<!-- role involves the regulation of gene expression by interfering with -->

Information flow in an organism takes place from DNA to RNA to protein.
DNA dictates the structure of mRNA in a process known as
**transcription**, and RNA dictates the structure of protein in a
process known as **translation**. This is known as the **"Central
Dogma"** of molecular biology, (though there are important exceptions).

### Protein function

The shape of a protein is critical to its function. For example, enzymes
bind to other molecules at a site known as their **active site**. If
this active site is altered because of the interference of a chemical
such as a drug or toxin, the enzyme may be unable to bind to the
substrate. Similarly, a mutation in the DNA that codes for the protein
can change the shape of the active site and prevent it from functioning
properly.

The unique sequence for every protein is therefore ultimately determined
by the gene encoding the protein. A change in nucleotide sequence of the
gene's coding region may lead to a different amino acid being added to
the growing polypeptide chain, causing a change in protein structure and
function. In condition sickle cell anemia, part of the protein
hemoglobin has a single amino acid substitution, causing a change in
protein structure and function. Hemoglobin has about 600 amino acids.
The structural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a
sickle cell molecule -- which dramatically decreases life expectancy -
is a single amino acid of the 600. What is even more remarkable is that
those 600 amino acids are encoded by three nucleotides each, and the
mutation is caused by a single base change (point mutation), 1 in 1800
bases. Because of this change of one amino acid in the chain (and 1
nucleotide in the underlying DNA code), hemoglobin molecules form long
fibers that distort the normal shape of red blood cells, turning them
into a crescent or "sickle" shape, which clogs arteries. This can lead
to myriad serious health problems such as breathlessness, dizziness,
headaches, and abdominal pain for those affected by this disease.

### Summary

**Nucleic acids** are molecules made up of **nucleotides** that direct
cellular activities such as cell division and protein synthesis. There
are two types of nucleic acids: DNA and RNA. DNA carries the genetic
blueprint of the cell and is passed on from parents to offspring (in the
form of chromosomes). It has a double-helical structure with the two
strands running in opposite directions. RNA is single-stranded. RNA
provides the template for protein synthesis. Messenger RNA (mRNA) is
copied from the DNA and contains information for the construction of
proteins.
